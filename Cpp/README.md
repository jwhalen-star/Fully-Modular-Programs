# Coding in Cpp

Welcome to my "Coding in Cpp" practice repository.
Within this repository you will find some structured pseudocode representations of Cpp programs, as well as actual code I have written in Cpp in which I explore various fundamental coding strategies and concepts.
Within these various programs, you will clearly see proficient implementation and a demonstration of comprehensive knowledge of core coding techniques and Cpp syntax.
